# Accident Dashboard  
**A Tableau-based analytical tool for visualizing road accident trends and risk factors**  
*Developed by Manar Ebrahim*  

---

## 📌 Overview  
This interactive dashboard provides insights into road accident severity, vehicle involvement, casualty statistics, and environmental factors (e.g., road surfaces, weather). Designed for policymakers, traffic authorities, and urban planners, it highlights critical risk areas to inform safety strategies.  

---

## 🚀 Key Features  
1. **Severity-Vehicle Count Correlation**  
   - Visualizes the relationship between accident severity and the number of vehicles involved.  
   - Ranges from **0K** (minor incidents) to **1000K** (severe collisions).  

2. **Casualty Analysis by Road Surface**  
   - Breakdown of casualties under road conditions managed by *Rand Surface Co., P.*.  
   - Highlights high-risk surfaces (e.g., **500K casualties**).  

3. **Road Surface & Weather Impact**  
   - Compares accidents under conditions like **Cw** (likely "Condition: Wet") and **Ew** (likely "Extreme Weather").  

4. **Weather-Related Challenges**  
   - Tracks delays in emergency response (*Time to begin winds*) and rerouting issues.

## 📂 Data Sources  
- **Primary Dataset**: Road accident records (severity, vehicle count, casualties).  
- **Environmental Data**: Road surface conditions (e.g., wet, icy) and weather reports.  
- **Third-Party**: Rand Surface Co. for road maintenance metrics.

![Severity-Vehicle Chart](https://via.placeholder.com/400x200?text=Severity+vs.+Vehicle+Count)  
- X-axis: Accident Severity | Y-axis: Vehicle Count (0K–1000K).  

### 2. Casualty by Road Surface  
![Casualty Surface Chart](https://via.placeholder.com/400x200?text=Rand+Surface+Casualties)  
- Categories: 500K, 150K, 120K, 140K, 200K, 250K.  

### 3. Road & Weather Conditions  
![Conditions Chart](https://via.placeholder.com/400x200?text=Cw+vs.+Ew)  
- Compares **Cw** (road surface) and **Ew** (weather) impacts.  

---

## 💡 Key Insights  
- **High vehicle density** correlates with severe accidents.  
- **500K casualties** on a specific road surface demand urgent intervention.  
- Ambiguous labels (e.g., *Routing no payments*) require clarification for deeper analysis.  

---

## 🔧 Future Enhancements  
- Add real-time data integration for dynamic risk monitoring.  
- Include filters for time-of-day, driver demographics, and accident types.  
- Clarify acronyms (**Cw**, **Ew**) and ambiguous metrics.
